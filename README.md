# RecruitIn: A Job Recruitment Platform

## Problem
We've recognized inefficiencies in our current Training and Placement (TNP) cell procedures. The manual email dissemination of job opportunities, followed by individual applications, is labor-intensive and prone to delays.
To address this, we're exploring tech-driven solutions like a centralized online platform to streamline the process. 
This will reduce workload for students and staff, while offering real-time updates on application statuses and improving accessibility to job opportunities.


## Features

- **User Authentication**: Students, companies, and TNP members can register and log in securely to access their respective functionalities.

- **Student Dashboard**: Students can create profiles, upload resumes, and browse job listings tailored to their skills and interests. They can also track the status of their applications and receive notifications about upcoming interviews.

- **Company Dashboard**: Companies can create profiles, post job listings, and search for suitable candidates based on specific criteria. They can also review applications, schedule interviews, and communicate with students directly through the platform.

- **TNP Dashboard**: TNP members have administrative privileges to manage student and company accounts, review job postings, and facilitate communication between students and companies. They can also generate reports and analytics to track placement trends and outcomes.
